Scientific evidence shows that if each donation is less than 1/10 of the amount of blood in the body, it is not harmful to health.

<br>* Actual basis:
<br>- In fact, there have been millions of people who have donated blood many times and are still in completely good health. There are people in the world who donate blood more than 400 times. In Vietnam, the person who donated blood the most times donated nearly 100 times and was in completely good health.
<br>- Thus, if each person is in good health, does not have infectious diseases through blood transfusion, and meets blood donation standards, they can donate blood 3-4 times a year, without adversely affecting their health. of yourself, while ensuring good quality and safe blood for patients.</div>
